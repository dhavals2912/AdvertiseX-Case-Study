# AdvertiseX-Case-Study
To address the challenges outlined in the AdvertiseX case study, we'll break down the solution into several key components: data ingestion, data processing, data storage, and error handling & monitoring. Each component will be designed to handle the unique requirements of the different data formats (JSON, CSV, Avro) and ensure scalability, efficiency, and reliability.
Data Ingestion System

The data ingestion system should be capable of handling real-time and batch data processing. Given the variety of data formats, a flexible architecture using Apache Kafka could be ideal. Kafka can ingest data in real-time from various sources, including webhooks for JSON and CSV data, and direct integration for Avro data. Here's a simplified architecture:

    Kafka Producers: Implement producers that push JSON, CSV, and Avro data to Kafka topics based on the data type.
    Apache Kafka Cluster: Set up a Kafka cluster to act as a central hub for ingesting and buffering data before further processing.
    Kafka Connect: Use Kafka Connect to stream CSV and Avro data directly into Kafka topics, simplifying the ingestion process.

# Example Kafka Producer for JSON data
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
                         value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))

data = {'ad_creative_id': '123', 'user_id': '456', 'timestamp': '2024-06-09T12:34:56Z', 'website': 'example.com'}
producer.send('ad_impressions', data)
producer.flush()

Data Processing

After ingestion, data needs to be transformed and standardized. This involves:

    Data Transformation: Use Apache Spark for processing large datasets efficiently. Spark can read from Kafka, transform the data, and write back to Kafka or directly to a storage solution like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon S3.
    Data Validation, Filtering, and Deduplication: Implement Spark transformations to validate data integrity, filter irrelevant records, and remove duplicates.

# Example Spark Job for Data Transformation
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AdDataProcessing").getOrCreate()

# Read JSON data from Kafka topic
df_json = spark.read.json("kafka://localhost:9092/ad_impressions")

# Perform transformations
df_transformed = df_json.selectExpr("CAST(ad_creative_id AS STRING)", "CAST(user_id AS STRING)", "CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP)", "CAST(website AS STRING)")

# Write transformed data back to Kafka or another storage solution
df_transformed.write.csv("/path/to/output/directory")

Data Storage and Query Performance

For efficient storage and query performance, consider using a columnar storage format like Parquet or ORC, which are optimized for analytics workloads. These formats allow for faster query execution and reduced storage space compared to row-based formats like CSV.

    Parquet or ORC: Convert the transformed data into these formats for efficient storage and querying.
    Query Optimization: Utilize tools like Apache Hive or Presto for querying the stored data, optimizing performance through partitioning and indexing strategies.

Error Handling and Monitoring

Implement a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system using tools like Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Additionally, integrate logging frameworks like Logstash or Fluentd to capture detailed logs from the data pipeline.

    Alerting Mechanisms: Configure alerts for critical events such as data ingestion failures, processing errors, or significant deviations in data patterns.
    Real-Time Monitoring: Monitor the health and performance of the data pipeline continuously to identify and resolve issues promptly.
